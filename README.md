Wind & Pressure plugin for X-Plane 10
=====================================

This plugin shows the QNH and the current wind when you press F1.

The plugin is written in Python so you need Sandy Barbour's Python Interface plugin available at http://xpluginsdk.org/ installed in X-Plane 10.

This file works in both 32 and 64 bit version of X-Plane.

Installation
------------

Copy "PI_WindPressure.py" in the "X-Plane 10/Resources/plugins/PythonScripts" folder.
